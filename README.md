### CLI Chess implementation â€“ The Odin Project - Ruby course capstone project:

## Usage
- Main running script written in the Game class, just run `ruby lib/game.rb` in your terminal to start.
- Written with TDD, just run `rspec` in your terminal.

## Points of note:
- User input error on move formats is with the 'front end' CLI user input tested for validity via conditional format checks and print messages to user. User input is checked on the back end before it's saved on the Player's @moves variable via creating exception objects of a custom InvalidUserInput class.


## Tasks
- Introduce concept of player moves;
  - script for user command
  - check for valid moves
  - accept or decline move
  - make move
    - move piece, delete any taken piece, check game_status, toggle active player
- build valid moves into each piece class;
  - piece_valid_moves
  - valid within board bounds
  - valid within squre colour rules
  - validity within context of other board piece types and positions
- Introduce concept of game status;
  - Check
  - Checkmate
  - Stalemate
- Introduce game saving feature;
  - serialise game, board & plater instances
  - save to file
  - reload from file


## Potential Refactorings

- #active_player code perhaps move from Game to Player class?
- for black and white positions just a class variable or two arrays on Board?
