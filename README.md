### CLI Chess implementation â€“ The Odin Project - Ruby course capstone project:

## Usage
*The running script is located in lib/main.rb*
1. In your console navigate to the directory's root.
2. Then type `ruby lib/main.rb` to run the programme.
3. Follow the terminal prompts from there.

## Program Summary and Architecture
- Built via TDD, run `rspec` from application root to help familiarise yourself with the code via ~244 tests.
- All behavior is unit tested, except load and save functionality.
- The program IO uses chess notation; source colrow, destination colrow, e.g. 'a2,a4', adapting it into index format (rowcolrowcol, e.g. '6040') to work with the grid's 2d x8 arrays containing x8 elements.
- Input errors are handled by custom written format checking rescue methods.
- Game#get_move validates user input against:
  - format, e.g. 'b1,c1'.
  - a real move; i.e. moving from one square to a different square.
  - first move rules.
  - in board 8x8 scope.
- Game#make_move runs game rule and piece rule validation against the move, via the each piece class' #valid_move.
- Game rule checks are implemented via game's #moves_into_check?, #checkmate?, #stalemate? and #king_taken methods, called by Game#make_move.
- Players' turns toggle until the game's @game_finished evaluates to true according to various game rule state checking methods (as mentioned in above point).
- Once moves are validated against format, game rule and game state, they're stored in Game's @moves array and taken pieces stored in @taken_pieces array.
- IO helper methods are located in UiModule and IO string content is stored as YAML data in data.yml. IO is printed to console via UiModule#display_string which introduces typing delays for nicer UX.
- Save & load logic is stored in the SaveAndLoadModule, logic being called via Game#old_or_new_game. Saved games are located in the ../Games/ directory.

## Code DSL
- r = row
- c = column
- index format = row first then column (not chess notation which is the reverse).
- src_r, src_c = 0-7 integer for piece source row, 0-7 integer for piece source column.
- dst_r, dst_c = 0-7 integer for piece move destination row, 0-7 integer for piece move destination column.
- src = an array of r and c integer values, representing the moving piece's starting location, e.g. [0, 0].
- dst = an array of r and c integer values, representing the movind piece's destination location, e.g. [1, 0].
- move = a 4 char string of numeric values representing src + dst joined, e.g. '0010'. 

__________________________________________

## Potential Refactorings
- #active_player code perhaps move from Game to Player class?
- for black and white positions just a class variable or two arrays on Board?
- Eliminate a piece's x and y, and just look up location from board.grids, any benefit in a piece storing it's own location?
- Instead of individual piece classes inheriting from Piece class, turn Piece class into a module and extend it to all individual piece type classes?
- Two types of errors are currently used, custom written methods e.g. in get_move, and a custom InputError class as used in add_move and board#piece. Unify this into one error handling strategy.
- Use Struct objects to create x & y named variables for square values instead of keeping referring to array indexes.
- Better enforcement of public & private method visibility.
- Run Rubocop

## Next Todo's 
- Complete unit testing of Game#make_move.
- introduce Error classes for why a move cannot be made, e.g. off board, against piece's rules, other piece blocks you, wrong colour square?
- introduce more begin/rescue blocks (e.g.; file save, ... , ... , ...)
- Integration tests for game flow (#play)(?)
- Refactor code in Game class
- Write castling functionality.
- Write Pawn en-passant functionality.
- Write Pawn promotion functionality.
- Revisit all tests and refactor.
- Write integration tests.
- Build a GUI.
